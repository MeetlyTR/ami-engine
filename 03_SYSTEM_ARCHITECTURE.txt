03_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE

You are a senior software architect designing a production-grade AI system.

Design a modular architecture for Artificial Moral Intelligence (AMI).

System layers:

/core
  /perception
  /impact_simulation
  /value_system
  /moral_reasoning
  /decision_optimizer
  /explainability

/simulator
/tests
/api
/sdk
/benchmarks

Tasks:

1. Define responsibilities of each module
2. Define data flow between modules
3. Define message and event contracts
4. Define microservice / monolith tradeoffs
5. Define scalability strategy
6. Define safety and fail-safe architecture

Requirements:

- Modular
- Replaceable components
- Strong test isolation
- Explainable decision traceability
- Deterministic + stochastic hybrid reasoning

Output:

- System diagram
- Module API contracts
- Data flow pipelines
- Deployment architecture
