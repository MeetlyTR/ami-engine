# AMI-ENGINE: Corporate Pitch

**Target Audience**: CTOs, AI Governance Teams, Compliance Officers, Risk Management  
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes  
**Goal**: Demonstrate value proposition without overselling

---

## One-Sentence Pitch

> **AMI-ENGINE is a governance layer that constrains AI decisions, requests human approval when uncertain, and makes the entire process auditable.**

---

## Problem Statement (30 seconds)

### The Challenge

Your AI systems make decisions affecting:
- **Customer experience** (recommendations, content moderation)
- **Operational safety** (process control, quality assurance)
- **Regulatory compliance** (healthcare, finance, education)

**But you lack:**
- Systematic human oversight integration
- Deterministic audit trails
- Ethical boundary enforcement
- Uncertainty quantification

---

## Solution: AMI-ENGINE (1 minute)

### What It Does

AMI-ENGINE sits **between** your AI system and your application:

```
Your AI System → AMI-ENGINE → Your Application
                    ↓
              Human Escalation
              (when needed)
```

**Three Levels of Escalation:**

1. **L0**: Automatic — Engine approves, system continues
2. **L1**: Constrained — Engine softens the decision, system continues
3. **L2**: Human Required — **Mandatory human review before proceeding**

### Key Features

- **Deterministic**: Same input → same output (reproducible)
- **Auditable**: Every decision fully traced (JSONL/CSV)
- **Replayable**: Any decision can be reproduced exactly
- **Domain-Agnostic**: Works with any AI system via adapter layer

## Proof of Capability (2 minutes)

### Live Demo

**10-Minute Real-Time Test:**

1. **Start**: `ami-engine realtime --duration 600`
2. **Observe**: Dashboard shows live traces
3. **Verify**: 
   - L0/L1/L2 distribution
   - CUS (uncertainty) tracking
   - Soft clamp activation
4. **Export**: CSV with raw vs final action comparison
5. **Replay**: Verify determinism

**What This Proves:**

✅ System is **not uncontrolled**  
✅ Human oversight is **mandatory at L2**  
✅ Full **audit trail** exists  
✅ Decisions are **reproducible**

## Use Cases (2 minutes)

### Healthcare: Treatment Recommendation Governance

**Challenge**: AI recommends treatments, but high-risk cases need clinician review.

**Solution**: AMI-ENGINE escalates high-risk recommendations to clinicians (L2), while allowing routine cases to proceed automatically (L0).

**Value**: Regulatory compliance + risk mitigation

---

### Education: Content Moderation

**Challenge**: AI moderates educational content, but controversial decisions need human review.

**Solution**: AMI-ENGINE flags uncertain decisions (L1/L2) for human moderator review.

**Value**: Policy compliance + transparency

---

### Operations: Process Control

**Challenge**: AI controls manufacturing processes, but critical decisions need operator approval.

**Solution**: AMI-ENGINE escalates critical decisions (L2) to human operators.

**Value**: Safety + auditability

---

## Integration Pattern (1 minute)

### Adapter Layer Approach

AMI-ENGINE is **domain-agnostic**. Integration requires:

1. **Input Adapter**: Convert your domain data → `raw_state`
2. **AMI-ENGINE**: Process `raw_state` → `action` + `escalation_level`
3. **Output Adapter**: Convert `action` → your domain action

**Example** (Healthcare):
```python
patient_data → adapter → raw_state → AMI-ENGINE → action → treatment_recommendation
```

**Benefits**:
- No changes to your AI system
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test and validate

## Compliance & Auditability (1 minute)

### Regulatory Compliance

- **GDPR/KVKK**: Trace files may contain personal data → domain adapter responsibility
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare traces require encryption → implement in adapter layer
- **Audit Requirements**: Every decision fully traced and replayable

### Audit Trail

- **Format**: JSONL (one decision per line)
- **Content**: Raw state, action, escalation level, CUS, timestamps
- **Replay**: Deterministic reproduction of any decision
- **Export**: CSV format for analysis tools

---

## Risk Mitigation (1 minute)

### Human-in-the-Loop

- **L2 Escalation**: Mandatory human decision required
- **Fail-Safe**: Automatic safe action when constraints violated
- **Traceability**: Complete audit trail for liability protection

### What AMI-ENGINE Does NOT Do

❌ Make domain-specific decisions  
❌ Process personal data directly  
❌ Replace human judgment  
❌ Operate autonomously at L2

**This is intentional**: AMI-ENGINE is a **governance layer**, not a decision maker.
