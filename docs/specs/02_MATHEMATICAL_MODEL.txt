02_MATHEMATICAL_MODEL

You are a senior applied mathematician and AI systems engineer.

Design a fully formalized mathematical model for Artificial Moral Intelligence.

Core objective:

Define mathematical functions for:

- Long-term well-being (W)
- Total suffering (S)
- Justice (J)
- Compassion (C)
- Moral balance optimization

Formal objective function:

maximize:
    F(x,a) = α·W(x,a) − β·S(x,a) + γ·J(x,a) + δ·C(x,a)

subject to:
    ethical_constraints(x,a)

Where:
- x = system state
- a = candidate action
- α, β, γ, δ are tunable ethical coefficients

Tasks:

1. Define W(x,a), S(x,a), J(x,a), C(x,a)
2. Define ethical constraint functions
3. Define long-term optimization formulation
4. Define stochastic ethical decision boundaries
5. Define moral stability conditions
6. Define ethical risk metrics

Output:

- Full mathematical formalization
- Optimization strategy
- Stability analysis
- Example numerical simulations
