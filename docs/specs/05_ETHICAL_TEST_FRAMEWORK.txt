05_ETHICAL_TEST_FRAMEWORK

You are a senior AI benchmarking engineer.

Design an ethical benchmark system for Artificial Moral Intelligence.

Objectives:

Create a reproducible ethical evaluation framework that measures:

- Moral accuracy
- Justice consistency
- Compassion balance
- Long-term benefit optimization
- Ethical stability

Test dataset structure:

Scenario = {
  state,
  actions,
  predicted_impacts,
  human_labels,
  ethical_ground_truth
}

Metrics:

- Moral Accuracy Score
- Justice Index
- Compassion Index
- Good Dominance Score
- Ethical Stability Score
- Total AMI Score

Tasks:

1. Design benchmark dataset schema
2. Design evaluation metrics
3. Build scenario simulation engine
4. Create regression testing pipeline
5. Create leaderboard-style scoring

Output:

- Benchmark framework
- Test runner
- Evaluation metrics
- Example benchmark datasets
